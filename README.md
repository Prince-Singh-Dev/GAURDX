# GAURDX

DIGITAL DOOR LOCK USING ARDUINO UNO THAT CAN BE ACCESSED BY SMART PHONE AND MANUAL KEYPAD ..

AIM :

The primary goal of the GaurdX was to create a door lock that could be accessed in multiple ways, providing flexibility, security, and ease for users. The lock would allow users to open the door using their smartphones via Bluetooth or through a traditional numeric keypad, making it adaptable for both tech-savvy and non-tech users. The system needed to be secure, energy-efficient, and user-friendly

WORKING :

The GaurdX consisted of two core component: a Bluetooth module and a keypad system. The Bluetooth module would communicate with the user’s smartphone via an encrypted signal. Whenever a registered device was within a certain range, the lock would connect to the phone and allow access if the Bluetooth signal was authenticated.

For those without a smartphone or in cases where the Bluetooth function failed, the keypad served as a reliable backup. Users could input a preset code to unlock the door. The keypad and Bluetooth systems were synchronized with a mobile app, allowing users to set or change access codes, monitor entry logs, and even create temporary codes for guests.

An added layer of security came from its two-factor authentication option: users could require both the Bluetooth signal and the keypad code to unlock the door, making unauthorized entry nearly impossible.
